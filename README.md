# Control panel

## Description
I created this control panel for Applied Database 1 stuff using php and mysql in the back and mainly bootstrap in the front.

## Objective
The objective is not only to present what was requested by the teacher but also to put into practice the knowledge acquired with the bootstrap course carried out on Udemy
